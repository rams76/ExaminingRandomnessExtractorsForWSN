This folder contains source code for quantization of measured value and converting the quantized value to binary file for entropy measurement. 

1. src : This folder contains "ToBinary.c" and "toBIT.c" files. The "toBIT.c" file is used for quantization and "ToBinary.c" file is used for converting the quantized file into binary. 

2. bin : This folder contains executable obtained compiling src file using Visual Studio 15 as well as Ubuntu 16.04.
