# ExaminingRandomnessExtractorsForWSN
This repository contains source code for physical sources of randomness implemented using JeeNode devices, randomness extractors. The random bit sequences obtained from physical sources is also published.

*************************************************************************
The repository of the project consists of following folders.

1. Folder-1 "DataCollection": This folder contains the source code for capturing the data from the randomness source using JeeNode device as well as captured and processed data.
2. Folder-2 "DataProcessing" : This folder contains the source code for processing the collected data, mainly quantization of data and conversion to binary file.
3. Folder-3 "EntropyExtractors" : The source code and binary files for the entropy extractors (deterministic, seeded and multi-source)are included in this folder.
4. Folder-4 "EntropyMeasurement" : The code obtained from https://github.com/usnistgov/SP800-90B_EntropyAssessment and compiled binary files to carry out the entropy measurement.
5. Folder-5 "GraphPlotting" : This folder contains R-code, measured RSS and resistance files and images.
