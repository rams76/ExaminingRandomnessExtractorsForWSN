*************************************************************************
This folder contains source code for Arduino board to collect the data as well as collected data. 

1. RSS_source : This folder contains the source code for collecting RSS data for Arduino board. Two wireless nodes are required to collect RSS data. One node with ID=10 at transmitter and another node with ID=20 as master.

2. PHOTO_RES_source : This folder contains source for measuring the resistance of photoresistor through port A4 of Arduino board.

  
3. OutputData : This folder contains the collected RSS data under stationary and limited mobility condition and resistance value of photoresistor. The data is collected using python script "SerialDump.py"
